# 🎤 Monad Anti-Beat

Monad Anti-Beat is a rhythm game built for (https://monad.xyz/), but with a twist:  
👉 The worse your sense of rhythm, the higher your score!

## 🌟 Concept & Motivation  

I was always frustrated that people with a "good musical ear" get all the praise, while those of us who are off-beat are overlooked.  
So I built Monad Anti-Beat — a game where finally people with "bad musical timing" can shine.  

The idea is simple:  
- Hit keys or click during the song.  
- The "further off-beat" you are, the more points you score.  
- In this world, being the "worst singer" is the only way to win.  

I even recorded the main track myself — completely raw, completely off-beat, just as the game intends.  
And soon, I’ll be adding new original songs I’ve recorded, so the challenge (and the chaos) grows over time.
